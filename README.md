# Better-Rock-Paper-Scissors
This is a remake of the game I've already made but I wanted to practice more with JS. I'm still not amazing with it but I'm getting there. There is no real css styling with this one. I'm already at a point where I understand it to a good degree I only made this for JS practice.
